# UNDER THE ICE

Under The Ice is a website designed to draw users into the practice of using Cold Therapy to see benefits in their day to day life. This is projected with a neutral color scheme and clean displays of information.

The website is structured into 5 segments:
- The landing part of the page is native to the user and consists simply of a header, navigation section, and main image with a caption to subtly tell the user what the page is about.
- The science section includes a variety of benefits created by cold exposure, this lets the user read the benefits and see if it is something the user would like to accomplish. This draws a particular reader profile which aligns with the targetted audience.
- The Dive section which includes a small descriptive way of how to start practicing cold therapy at home, along with a supportive video which contains content of people describing experience with cold bathing.
- Committing section is a section which provides a small bit of text inspiring the user to push through and start practicing what the website is projecting, essentially a small hook to get users to sign up to the news letter.
- The footer which simply contains social media links that lead to the social media page, and copyright information.


The Design of the Webpage:
- The website is designed with a neutral, calming but popping color scheme. The hints of orange bring attention to the user and is used on critical website functions such as highlighting important content, links or buttons.
