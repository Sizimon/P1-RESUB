            <div class="box">
                <h3>More Energy</h3>
                <p>You will learn to focus on the things that matter and to let go of stressors that only cost you energy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Better Sleep</h3>
                <p>People who practice cold exposure often report that their sleep quality is improved, and that they are feeling more energetic during the day.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Workout Recovery</h3>
                <p>Help your body to recover faster from physical exercise and reduce muscle soreness after intense workouts, by starting cold exposure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Cold Exposure and Will Power</h3>
                <p> Nobody wants to get in a cold shower. Getting under freezing cold water every morning trains the brain to do things it doesn’t spontaneously want to. This attitude could then translate to other areas of your life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Combats Oxidative Stress</h3>
                <p>One study found that people who regularly swim in ice-cold water had relatively high levels of reduced glutathione, an antioxidant that's vital for detoxing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Strengthen Nervous System</h3>
                <p>The increase in fat burning during cold exposure is modulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Cold temperatures act as a mild “workout” for the nervous system, which adapts and strengthens.</p>

        <h2>The Dive</h2>
        <p>Starting your journey with the cold is not an easy first step, since you are putting your body through a situation which is not necessarily comfortable at first. However the benefits are too good to miss,
            so punching through that first layer of ice is not too far ahead of you. Start with taking cold showers for a minute a day. If you want to challenge yourself more,
            change the shower to cold after taking a hot shower to provide a shock to the blood vessels and induce a responce from the body.<br>
            Here is a more in depth beginners explaination to cold exposure!
